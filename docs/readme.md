---

Horizon is the server for the client facing API for the Stellar ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [stellar-core](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/stellar-core) and applications that want to access the Stellar network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Stellar ecosystem](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/) for more details.

SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/js-stellar) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.
Community maintained libraries (in various states of completeness) for interacting with Horizon in other languages:<br>
